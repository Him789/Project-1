 Project  Connect4 Game Jan 2021  Project descriptionThis project is mainly about Connect4 game. In this game there's a vertical board which has seven hollow columns and six rows. Each column has a hole in the upper part of the board, where pieces are introduced. There is a window for every square, so that pieces can be seen from both sides. Both players have a set of 21 thin pieces (like coins); each of them uses a different color. The board is empty at the start of the game.
